# quicklook-shelf-configurator

This repository is a fork of [elm-3d-scene](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene) by **@ianmackenzie**, a high-level Elm package for producing 3D graphics.

It adds an example WebApp to the engine's example folder (`examples/IvarConfig.elm` and `examples/IvarConfig.html`) that features a **sample WebGL product configurator** including the ability to preview the product in AR (Augmented Reality) with **Apple AR Quicklook**, a feature available on macOS 10.15+ and iOS 12+. 

# Disclaimer:

The product to configure looks like a well known IKEA shelf family called IVAR, but it's not affiliated with IKEA and is not guaranteed to fit your room. To configure a shelf was choosen to proof it's flexibility.

Any questions/feedback to this fork, please open an issue or reach out to **@pixelpartner**
